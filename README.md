This is definitely the longest and most meaningful hardware design project I have ever done.

So roughly 6 months ago, as my interest in my newly acquired Raspberry Pi 4 grew, I decided to buy a 10'' portable monitor and a small keyboard to more properly use my it as a computer (and it has proven itself much more than that).

After using the new setup in the morning for homework and occasional coding/retro gaming, I was curious as the potential of this little computer as a portable computing device, like an iPad.
I started attaching the Raspberry Pi and a Daughter board (for extra ports) and extra custom sized cables onto the back of the 10'' display. 
There was even a plan to open up the display and deconstruct it to put the boards inside the case. This was later dismissed because it would risk breaking a 120$ display.
